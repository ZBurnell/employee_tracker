# employee_tracker
challenge #12 - SQL

# Description
I set out to create a command line application that would allow an employeer to track their employees by a few different criteria. This project was tough and needs some work to be fully polished and working. I am looking forward to developing this further and impleminting a few changes to get it functioning as it should.
