# employee_tracker
OSU Fullstack Bootcamp - Week 12 Challenge

# Description
I set out to create a command line application that would allow an employer to track their employees by looking at a few simple tables. An emplyer is able to quickly search and see what employees are currently working for their company, what their title, Salary and who their manager is. On top of all of that they are also able to make changes to their roles as well as add new employees to the database. This project was tough and really challenged me at times. In the end I am happy with how I was able to implement everything I set out to do at the beginning of the project. Thiscould also be a helpful tool to use in the future for quickly storing information in a MySQL database.

# Usage

from the command line while in the repo you can initiate the app using "node index.js". Video will also be linked that shows how to start and use the application.

 Requires these add ons before initialization in the command line.

# Credits
  
I used information provided in the OSU-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC repo as a guideline on how to create this application. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant and Stack over flow when errors would Command line errors would pop up..
